# Key Creation Update + Reminder on AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
Update for Generating Keys
In the upcoming lecture, we will be creating an IAM user and then generating a key pair for deployment. There is a minor required change to this flow. Instead of being prompted to create a key pair during the IAM user creation, you must first create the IAM user, then, create a key pair associated with that user. AWS has also changed the terminology from Programmatic Access to Command Line Interface (CLI).

Full updated instructions can be found below:

1. Search for "IAM"

2. Click "Create Individual IAM Users" and click "Manage Users"

3. Click "Add User"

4. Enter any name you’d like in the "User Name" field.

5. Click "Next"

6. Click "Attach Policies Directly"

7. Use the search bar to find and tick AmazonS3FullAccess and CloudFrontFullAccess

8. Click "Next"

14. Select "Command Line Interface (CLI)"


15. Scroll down and tick the "I understand..." check box and click "Next"

16. Copy and/or download the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key to use for deployment.

Reminder on AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
A few lectures ago we mentioned the need to use a different action and left a placeholder for the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION key.

Let's make sure this gets set correctly now.

In the AWS Dashboard use the Services search bar to find S3 and load its dashboard. Once there, copy the AWS region listed to the right of your bucket:


Then, in your container.yml, paste in the value for the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION like so:

      - uses: shinyinc/action-aws-cli@v1.2
      - run: aws s3 sync dist s3://${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME }}/container/latest
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: us-east-2
